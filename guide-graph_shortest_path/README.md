# Shortest path with Kinetica
This guide shows how to create a graph and then use the shortest path solver to find routes that take the least amount of time to traverse between - a single source to single destination, a single source to many destinations and many sources to many destinations.

The instructions are provided within the workbook itself. Please use the [guide](https://github.com/kineticadb/kinetica-workbooks/blob/master/guide-graph_shortest_path/guide-graph_shortest_path.md)]] if you would like to read through the code and instructions without running the workbook.

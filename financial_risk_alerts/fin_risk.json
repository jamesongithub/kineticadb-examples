This is a really simple demo that solves a challenging problem. The steps broadly are the following.\n1. Plug into streaming and static data sources and load the data into relational tables in Kinetica\n2. Setup a continuously updated risk monitoring view that combines portfolio holdings data with real time stock prices\n3. Setup up alerts via webhooks and/or sink the data to a Kafka topic\nAll of this is done with just a few simple SQL statements and relational tables.","user_id":"a14c1650-2236-11ed-8a68-5194ba1cb631","warehouse_id":null,"is_example":false,"is_shared":false,"created_at":"2022-03-02T19:44:09.007Z","updated_at":"2022-10-28T02:43:44.559Z","userId":"a14c1650-2236-11ed-8a68-5194ba1cb631"},"worksheets":[{"config":{},"id":"57141750-566a-11ed-b4f2-d95bad9d0083","name":"1.

# üöÄ Welcome
This project contains fully reproducible examples of using Kinetica. There are three types of content - 
1. Guides: Explore specific features of Kinetica using demo data.
2. Demos: Solve real world challenges with real world data.
3. Labs: Learn concepts and features through labs

Use the [catalog](https://github.com/kineticadb/kinetica-workbooks#-catalog) below to view a short description of each example and to access them.

# üèé Get started with Kinetica
### Install
If this is your first time using Kinetica use our [install guide](url) to install Kinetica.

### Import workbooks
Each folder in this repo contains a workbook file that is in the JSON format. You can load any of these into Kinetica with the following steps. 

To load a workbook, download any of the JSON files in this repository, then click the plus "+" icon in the [Workbook Explorer](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/azure/admin/workbench/ui/explorer/workbooks/) and select Import Workbook JSON.

# Help
Please join our [community slack channel](https://kinetica-community.slack.com/) to post any conceptual questions, clarifications with any of the content in this repo. Questions or clarifications can also be posted on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/kinetica) under the kinetica tag.

Issues related to reproducing a specific piece of content - for instance, a broken link, installation failures, bugs etc. - can be posted as an issue in this repo. Please reference the relevant piece of content in the title.

## Guides
Explore specific features of Kinetica using demo data.
### [Quick Start Workbook](https://github.com/kineticadb/kinetica-workbooks/tree/master/guide-quickstart)
Start your journey with a guided tour of Kinetica's analytics and visualization. Create data sources, ingest data from Amazon S3 and Kafka, then perform location analytics and visualize results on a map. Follow-along with Kinetica's [Quick Start Workbook](https://docs.kinetica.com/7.1/azure/guides/quick-start-workbook/) guide on available on Kinetica's documentation site.

### [Shortest Path](https://github.com/kineticadb/kinetica-workbooks/tree/master/guide-graph_shortest_path)
This guide shows how to create a graph and then use the shortest path solver to find routes that take the least amount of time to traverse between - a single source to single destination, a single source to many destinations and many sources to many destinations.


## Demos
Solve real world challenges with real world data.
### [Windmill Optimization](https://github.com/kineticadb/kinetica-workbooks/tree/master/demo-windmill_optmization)
Use Kinetica's UDF capability to predict the power output of windmills in North America. Create data sources, ingest data from Azure Blob and Kafka, create and run a Python-based linear regression UDF, then visualize the power output on a map.

## Labs
Coming soon

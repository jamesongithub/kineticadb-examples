THE ST FUNCTION LIBRARY
The ST functions library contains a wide range of functions related to spatial geometry, data analysis, and spatial data management. This library can be used to create and manipulate spatial data, perform spatial calculations and queries, generate maps and visualizations, and much more.
Kinetica offers more than 150 different ST_ functions. These can be broadly classified into the 3 categories shown below (based on their purpose).

WHAT IS A SPATIAL JOIN?
Spatial joins combine two different tables using a spatial relationship. They are used to answer questions such as ‚Äúwhich areas overlap‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere do the boundaries occur‚Äù, and ‚Äúwhat is the area covered by a certain feature‚Äù. Spatial joins are typically computationally expensive to perform especially on larger data. But not so in Kinetica.
A SPATIAL JOIN
In the code below, we use a join to identify records where a truck is within 200 meters of a particular fence.

/* TEXT Block Start */
/*
WHAT IS GEOFENCING?
Geofencing is a location-based service in which a software application uses GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a mobile device or RFID tag enters or exits a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location. Geofencing can be used for various purposes, such as sending notifications to customers when they enter or leave an area, providing targeted advertising based on location, and tracking employee time and attendance.
GEOFENCES
Take a look at the data set up sheet before proceeding. This will give you a good sense for what the query below is accomplishing. We have two tables of data. One is a stream that is recording live locations of different trucks Washington DC, while the second is a list of fences surrounding popular DC landmarks.
The query below identifies when a trucks GPS points falls within a fence. We only consider events that have occured in the last 5 minutes.
WHY IS THE MAP EMPTY?
First check if you have run the query below. The maps reference the data from the view that is created in that query. If the maps still stay empty it means that there are no geofencing events currently. But one will likely show up within a few minutes.
AUTOMAGICALLY UPDATE WITH A MATERIALIZED VIEW
The query below uses a materialized view that is set to refresh on change. So the results of this view are updated automatically whenever there is a new truck location added to Kinetica from the Kafka stream. A downstream application that relies on these geofencing events can simply point to this table in Kinetica and rely on our high speed key value lookups to deliver real time event alerts.

/*
WHAT ARE TRACKS?
Tracks are a
native
geospatial object in Kinetica (just like Points, Shapes and Labels). They represent objects in motion i.e. the path that an object takes over time.
HOW ARE TRACKS REPRESENTED?
Tracks use a combination of a track identifier, a timestamp value and X and Y coordinates to represent a path over time.
WHY ARE TRACKS USEFUL?
Pretty much any object that moves can be represented and studied using tracks. This has a wide range of application in almost all sectors of the economy including supply chain management, ride sharing, IoT devices.
WHATS THE BENEFIT OF STUDYING TRACKS IN KINETICA?
Kinetica come with a set of functions that can be used to compute attributes and to detect events such as geofencing and proximity to other tracks.
Apart from all the performance benefits, Kinetica's native track representation performs a key function, which is
track interpolation
, which allows us to infer events such as geofencing and proximity more accurately.

BIN TAXI TRIPS IN NY TO FIND HOTSPOTS
Spatial binning is a technique used in data analysis to group geographically-referenced data into user-defined bins or areas. The technique is used to reduce the resolution of a dataset, making it easier to visualize and analyze large datasets. This can be done by dividing the area into equal-sized rectangular grids, circles, polygons, or hexagons. The resulting bins are then used for statistical analysis such as calculating the frequency of events or measuring average values.
Kinetica offers two ways to generate grids - ST_HEXGRID or using H3 geohashing functions (based on Uber).
Let's use the latter to visualize hotspots for taxi pickups in New York. The steps are as follows.
1. Use STXY_H3() to generate the H3 index, which is a number that points to a specific h3 grid that contains a particular x and y point.
2. Use ST_GEOMFROMH3() to generate the corresponding geom for each index we generated in the previous step.

Routing is a key area of spatial analytics. Kinetica's can represent road networks as graphs against which we can issue powerful pre-built solvers and match algorithms. This makes it really easy to solve spatial problems with a routing flavor.
And what's more, Graphs in Kinetica are fully compatible with a relational data model, so you can integrate graph analytics with your existing analytical data pipelines without any friction.

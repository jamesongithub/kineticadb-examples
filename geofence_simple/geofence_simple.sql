This workbook illustrates the concept of geofencing using Kinetica.
WHAT IS GEOFENCING?
Geofencing is the ability to classify an object as being inside a defined geographical boundary.
WHAT IS A COMMON USECASE FOR GEOFENCING?
The most common use case for geofencing is to trigger an event (for instance an alert) when an object is inside or outside the fence. Some examples include,
1. Triggering an alert when a vehicle enters a restricted zone,
2. Alerting a customer when a delivery truck carrying a package is within a certain distance from their home
3. Sending alerts to a customer when they are close to certain locations they may be interested in visiting
HOW DOES THIS EXAMPLE WORK?
This example illustrates the first use case described above. Our data input for this example is a stream via Kafka of vehicle locations (6 vehicles). We are interested in knowing when a particular vehicle (vehicle 5) is inside a certain zone of interest in downtown Washington DC. For illustration purposes, we will stream the alerts to a webhook but you can alternatively set these up to be registered via kafka or any other custom application like Slack (via webhooks).

CREATE THE SCHEMA FOR THE EXAMPLE
Kinetica uses schema's to organize tables. It is good practice to have a schema defined for each project. Tables that are created without an explicit schema assignment are placed in the default schema ki_home.

LOAD THE DATA
We will be using a stream of vehicle locations. The steps for loading this data are as follows.
1. Define the table
2. Set up the credentials for connecting to the kafka cluster (Optional)
3. Define the data source

VISUALIZE THE VEHICLE LOCATIONS
Let's start by getting a sense for the location and movement of the vehicles. The speed of the vehicle is a bit accelerated for the demo for illustration purposes.
We will be specifically looking at vehicle 5. So we will start by setting up a materialized view which refreshes every 5 seconds to record new locations that are streaming in. The map below show the vehicle moving through downtown area in DC.

SETUP A STREAM OF ALERTS
A stream in Kinetica can be used to publish changes on a table to a target destination. This target could be a webhook or a Kafka topic.
GO TO WEBHOOK.SITE TO TRY THIS EXAMPLE ON YOUR OWN
The easiest way to test this code out is by using a webhook. You can generate one for free and observe requests coming in via the following website: https://webhook.site/.
Please visit
https://webhook.site/
to generate a webhook and paste it in the code below to create the stream. Once the stream is setup head back over to https://webhook.site/ to observe the requests coming in.
